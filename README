This is a save editor for the gba game
The Legend Of Zelda : A Link To The Past
I wanted to change the character name so i 
picked up no$gba and reversed the checksum
alghoritm. Additionally ive reversed other 
parts of the save so i could enable hidden 
sword powers and delete/recover slots.

Features:
- Change character name
- Enable beam sword/hurricane spin powers
- Fix slot checksums
- Delete slots
- Recover deleted slots (never overwritten)

The EUR version is byteswapped by 8 (wtf?)
and you must swap it using 'swap.py' before
and after editing. To use the script just do

python swap.py infile outfile

It checks just the main table and not the 
secondary one (0x1000) but as long as the 
primary is valid the game doesnt need that.

Ive also unrolled two patches to disable 
the checksum checking in game. Just put a
NOP (Thumb) (0x0000) and youre done :D

USA offsets : 0x08067e40 0x08067e4C
EUR offsets : 0x08068a08 0x08068a14
